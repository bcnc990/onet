  <h2>Methodology</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Scores for the following domains - abilities, knowledge, skills, and work activities - consist of importance as well
      as level. Importance is measured from 1 through 5 while level is measured from 1 through 7. These were rescaled to range
      from 1 to 100 and a combined score was created by multiplying the rescaled values of importance and level and then
      taking the square root. Work context and work styles were rescaled to range from 1 to 100.</li>
    <li>Competency scores are at an 8-digit ONET occupation code level. An average score was computed at a broader occupation
      category coded up to 6-digits.</li>
    <li>Earnings data are collected at the 6-digit occupation code. When only hourly earnings are available, annual earnings are
      derived by assuming a 2000 hour work year.</li>
    <li>Average scores and earnings for quartiles and major occupations are weighted by total employment in the occupation.</li>
    <li>Job zones were imputed by computing the average of the job zone values within the broader occupation category.
